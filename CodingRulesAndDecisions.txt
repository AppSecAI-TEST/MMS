      The purpose of this document is to contain implementation decisions which was made in
      the past, so that any developer can read this document and should be able to implement
      compatible code.


 Reader implementation:
************************
    Any implemented reader should return variables and attributes as close as possible to the original.

    For example:
      o It is mandatory, that any variable with a number data type must have a fill value attribute
        with the CF conform attribute name "_FillValue".
          o If the original variable don't have such an attribute assigned, a new one must be
            added to the variable.
          o If the original variable already have an fill value assigned, but with a NOT CF conform
            name, the attribute must be duplicated and the CF conform name must be set.
