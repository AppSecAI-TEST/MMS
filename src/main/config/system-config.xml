        Allows to specify custom archiving rules for sensors. Several rule tags are allowd. The path elements
        recognized during processing are
        - SENSOR - the sensor name
        - VERSION - the version string
        - YEAR - the year
        - MONTH - the month
        - DAY - the day.
        These will be epanded during processing to theit actual values. All other pathe elements are treated as
        constant values. The separator character is always the forward slash "/"
